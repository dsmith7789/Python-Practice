# Chess
I wanted to try to make a more complicated game than I had in the past (ex. Blackjack), with the end goal of allowing 2 players to play the game on different machines. This would let me also practice making a game with network capabilities.

# Project Setup

# Cool Features to add

- Win probability for current player
- "Intelligent" AI - maybe there's a model out there I can use?
- Multiplayer support
- Board skin
- Pieces skins
